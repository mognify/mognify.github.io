Auguest 12th, 2026 = next full solar eclipse
What season and place has the fewest clouds?
Is this a time and place where the next full solar eclipse will occur?

To see the moonrise at sunset
More specifically to see the moon transition at sunset.

Within the path of the August 12, 2026, total solar eclipse, several locations might be less frequented by tourists compared to others like northern Spain, which is popular for its scenic and cultural attractions. Here are some options that are likely less crowded and off the beaten path:

### 1. **Greenland**
   - **Tourism Popularity**: Greenland is remote and sparsely populated, with limited tourist infrastructure. While its unique Arctic landscape attracts adventurous travelers, it is far less visited than Iceland or Spain.
   - **Viewing Conditions**: August typically brings milder weather, but cloud cover can vary. Towns like Nuuk may offer viewing opportunities if accessible during the eclipse.

### 2. **Iceland (Northern/Remote Areas)**
   - **Tourism Popularity**: While Iceland is a popular tourist destination, certain northern or rural areas, especially outside major hubs like Reykjavik, are much less frequented. Examples include smaller towns in the Westfjords or northern parts of the island.
   - **Viewing Conditions**: Clear skies in rural Icelandic areas are more likely than in heavily populated regions.

### 3. **Northern Spain (Non-Major Tourist Towns)**
   - **Tourism Popularity**: Northern Spain includes well-known spots like Bilbao and San Sebasti√°n, but smaller towns and rural areas along the eclipse path, such as La Rioja's countryside or less-visited parts of Asturias, may see fewer visitors.
   - **Viewing Conditions**: Dry and sunny weather typical of August makes this region favorable.

### 4. **Faroe Islands (Near the Path)**
   - **Tourism Popularity**: While not directly on the path of totality, parts of the Faroe Islands might offer partial eclipse views. Their isolation keeps tourist numbers relatively low.

Choosing less popular destinations increases the likelihood of finding quieter, unobstructed viewing spots for the eclipse. Greenland and remote areas in Iceland are especially good choices for avoiding large crowds, provided you are prepared for their remoteness and unpredictable weather.
