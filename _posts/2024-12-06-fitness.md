- You don't want to be feeble, aching, tired.
- You need enough muscle mass to make life easier.
- If you don't exercise for a while, then the next time you do you'll become sore. This is why consistent exercise throughout your life is necessary.
- The older you are, the more painful this soreness becomes.
- Ideally you should possess an athletic physique in your youth.

``You should not begin procreation until you are physically capable of near-effortlessly handling the weight of the offspring for extended periods of time and over long distances.
For a mother: in her belly and in her arms.
For a father: holding the pregnant mother or all the necessary belongings.``

I'll try to separate this into 3 parts:
1. Stretching. This is to be done before any exercise.
2. Outdoor. Walking, jogging, running, hiking.
3. Indoor. Anything that can be done within the confines of a prison cell.

### Warm-up and Stretching
1. Jumprope

### Bodyweight

# Fitness and Readiness Guide

## The Importance of Physical Capability
- You don't want to be feeble, aching, or tired.
- Sufficient muscle mass makes daily life and physical tasks significantly easier.
- Inconsistent exercise leads to soreness when activity resumes, and this soreness intensifies with age.
- Maintaining consistent exercise throughout your life reduces the risk of pain and injury.
- Ideally, you should build an athletic physique in your youth to prepare for the physical demands of adulthood.

> **Procreation Readiness:**  
> You should not begin procreation until you are physically capable of near-effortlessly handling the weight of offspring for extended periods and long distances.  
> - **For a mother:** Carrying the child in her belly and in her arms.  
> - **For a father:** Supporting the pregnant mother or carrying all necessary belongings.
