- You don't want to be feeble, aching, tired.
- You need enough muscle mass to make life easier.
- If you don't exercise for a while, then the next time you do you'll become sore. This is why consistent exercise throughout your life is necessary.
- The older you are, the more painful this soreness becomes.
- Ideally you should possess an athletic physique in your youth.

``You should not begin procreation until you are physically capable of near-effortlessly handling the weight of the offspring for extended periods of time and over long distances.
For a mother: in her belly and in her arms.
For a father: holding the pregnant mother or all the necessary belongings.``
