First thing to get out of the way: when people talk about Calories, what they're referring to are KCalories. This is a nitpick. I'm just going to call it calories.

To identify how much you need to eat, first you need to know how much you're `expected to weigh`.
You can find out this information using the following tool:

After you know how much you 'should' weigh (estimate),
then you can find how much you should `eat per day` using this tool:

<https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html>

For `Activity` choose "`Sedentary`"

For `Goal` choose "`Maintain weight`"

In my example, you can see for `Food Energy` my target daily caloric intake is about 2225.

Remember:
- 1g Fat = 9 calories
- 1g Protein/Carb = 4 calories

"Ideally" your ratio of calories should be 40% carbs, 30% fats, and 30% proteins.
