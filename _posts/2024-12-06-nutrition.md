First thing to get out of the way: when people talk about Calories, what they're referring to are KCalories. This is a nitpick. I'm just going to call it calories.

## Ideal Weight

To identify how much you need to eat, first you need to know how much you're `expected to weigh`.
You can find out this information using the following tool:

## Caloric Requirements

After you know how much you 'should' weigh (estimate),
then you can find how much you should `eat per day` using this tool:

<https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html>

For `Activity` choose "`Sedentary`"

For `Goal` choose "`Maintain weight`"

In my example, you can see for `Food Energy` my target daily caloric intake is about 2225.

## Caloric Expenditures

Remember:
- 1g Fat = 9 calories
- 1g Protein/Carb = 4 calories

"Ideally" your ratio of calories should be 40% carbs, 30% fats, and 30% proteins.

## **Prenatal Nutrition**

Prenatal nutrition supports the growth of the fetus and the health of the mother. Increased energy, macronutrients, and specific micronutrients are crucial during this time.

``**Key Nutrients**``
- **Folate (Vitamin B9)**  
  - **Importance**: Prevents neural tube defects, supports DNA synthesis, and promotes healthy cell growth.  
  - **Sources**: Leafy greens, citrus fruits, fortified cereals, beans, and supplements.  
  - **Daily Need**: 600 mcg.

- **Iron**  
  - **Importance**: Supports increased blood volume and prevents anemia.  
  - **Sources**: Red meat, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, spinach, fortified cereals.  
  - **Daily Need**: 27 mg.

- **Calcium**  
  - **Importance**: Supports fetal bone and teeth development.  
  - **Sources**: Dairy products, fortified plant milk, leafy greens, tofu.  
  - **Daily Need**: 1,000 mg.

- **Vitamin D**  
  - **Importance**: Aids calcium absorption and immune function.  
  - **Sources**: Fortified milk, fatty fish, sunlight exposure.  
  - **Daily Need**: 600 IU.

- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**  
  - **Importance**: Critical for fetal brain and eye development.  
  - **Sources**: Salmon, walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds.  
  - **Daily Need**: 200-300 mg of DHA.

- **Protein**  
  - **Importance**: Supports fetal growth and maternal tissue repair.  
  - **Sources**: Meat, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts, tofu.  
  - **Daily Need**: ~71 g/day in the second and third trimesters.

``**General Recommendations**``
- **Calories**: Increase by ~300-500 kcal/day in the second and third trimesters.  
- **Hydration**: Drink ~8-12 cups of water daily.  
- **Avoid**: Alcohol, unpasteurized dairy, raw fish/meat, high-mercury seafood, and excessive caffeine.  
- **Supplements**: A prenatal vitamin is often recommended to ensure critical nutrients are covered.


## **Postnatal Nutrition**

Natal nutrition focuses on recovery from childbirth and providing nourishment for breastfeeding mothers.

``**Breastfeeding-Specific Nutrients**``
- **Calories**  
  - Increase intake by ~500 kcal/day while breastfeeding.

- **Protein**  
  - **Importance**: Supports milk production.  
  - **Needs**: 71 g/day or more.

- **Calcium and Vitamin D**  
  - **Importance**: Maintains maternal bone density and enhances milk quality.  
  - **Sources**: Same as during pregnancy.

- **Fluids**  
  - Drink enough water to stay hydrated (~12-16 cups/day).

- **Iodine and Selenium**  
  - **Importance**: Supports thyroid function and brain development in the baby.  
  - **Sources**: Iodized salt, seafood, nuts, and dairy.

``**General Postnatal Nutrition Tips**``
- **Eat nutrient-dense foods**: Whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables.  
- **Focus on recovery**: Include anti-inflammatory foods (e.g., berries, turmeric, green tea).  
- **Limit processed foods and added sugars**.  
- **Continue prenatal vitamins**: Often recommended while breastfeeding.

``**Special Considerations**``
- **Breastfeeding mothers**: Nutrient needs increase for milk production.  
- **Non-breastfeeding mothers**: Focus on balanced nutrition for recovery.  
- **Postnatal supplementation**: May be needed based on individual deficiencies.
