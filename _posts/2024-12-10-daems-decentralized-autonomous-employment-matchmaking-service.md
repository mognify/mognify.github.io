Applicants are honing their skills and talents to meet the needs of positions they're targeting. The application process shouldn't be a trial in itself. That's what the interview is for. 

It's insane to think that with all this ML/LLM, there's still no automated matchmaking service that provides employers with potential applicant targets, and applicants with potential employer targets.
There should be a pool where employers can say what they need, and where applicants can say what they can do, and the automated service should match them up. Both can say whether or not they're interested and why, and that would improve the process so everyone is getting who they want. (Obviously this is over-simplified, but I think you get the gist.)

I'm probably just ignorant about what's out there. It's possible this already exists or is implemented... but from what I've seen and heard, the only automation is in cheap auto-applications and cheap auto-application reviews... leading to good-faith employers with thousands of junk/irrelevant applications, and good-faith applicants with hundreds of unhelpful auto-rejection emails (this latter probably just for legal safety). This leaves both applicants and hiring managers in the dark about why applicants were denied.
Hostile, counterproductive, warfare-type environment.

From the applicant point of view: we have no clue what we're doing wrong or what we can do to improve.
My biggest guess as to what I'm doing wrong is maybe my resume isn't formatted for your ATS to scrape properly, maybe there's a certain keyword I left out that the ATS is auto-rejecting me for.
Every site I feed my resume to try and check if it's ATS compatible... it seems as if each one uses different ATS scraping criteria.
Recruiters also receive conflicting information regarding resume formatting in terms of opting for ATS vs. human-readability, and how to format it for ATS. There's seemingly no real standard, possibly due to industry-wide opacity.

_It's also possible that maybe I'm just blacklisted, but I'll never know.
I'll probably end up deleting this post so it doesn't harm my chances of being employed, but I felt the need to get this off my chest in a relevant forum._

I'd be interested in the development of a decentralized, autonomous employment matchmaking service with decentralized, incentivized oversight. The reason for this is mainly because I've heard about the obscene fees that employers have to pay just to post a job or to message an applicant (who might not even respond). The solution seems simple to me: cut out the inefficient, ineffective, counterproductive, abusive middlemen.
