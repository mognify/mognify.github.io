```
We are born. We grow to adults. We reproduce. We die.
For our birth and our development, we are at the mercy of others.

Once we become adults, we can do better for our descendants.
When we are adults, we can plan and prepare the manner of our death.
```
Focusing on your vessel first, as without this you cannot do anything
- You don't want to be feeble, aching, tired.
- You need enough muscle mass to make life easier.
- If you don't exercise for a while, then the next time you do you'll become sore. This is why consistent exercise throughout your life is necessary.
- The older you are, the more painful this soreness becomes.
- Ideally you should possess an athletic physique in your youth.

``You should not begin procreation until you are physically capable of near-effortlessly handling the weight of the offspring for extended periods of time and over long distances.
For a mother: in her belly and in her arms.
For a father: holding the pregnant mother or all the necessary belongings.``
