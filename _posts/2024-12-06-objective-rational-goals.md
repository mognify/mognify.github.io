We are born. We grow to adults. We reproduce. We die.
For our birth and our development, we are at the mercy of others.

Once we become adults, we can do better for our descendants.
When we are adults, we can plan and prepare the manner of our death.

**The Cult of Beauty**  

Todd sat in his small, dimly lit apartment, hunched over a desk cluttered with notes and books, surrounded by a faint air of unease. His pen scribbled furiously across the pages of an old journal, recording ideas that he knew would spark outrage—perhaps even danger.  

Todd had always been different. Since his youth, he had seen patterns others missed, connections between the spiritual, the physical, and the societal. His observations had coalesced into a single, unshakable conclusion: the state of humanity was a war between beauty and ugliness, and it was both nature and nurture that dictated the outcome.  

He titled his philosophy **"The Law of Beauty."** It combined his peculiar brand of moral absolutism with harsh pragmatism:  

- *Eugenics* was the key to purity and progress, the science behind beauty and virtue.  
- *Religion* was the hammer to enforce it, compelling people to follow the doctrine with fervor.  

But his ideas did not stop at superficial appearances. Todd had a seething disdain for systemic poisoning—what he called "the invisible rot." He traced the origins of so much human deformity and dysfunction to poisoned wombs, tainted food, and chemical-laden air and water. It wasn’t just genetics, he argued. It was sabotage.  

“The CIA black budget,” Todd muttered as he wrote, his lips curling into a bitter smile. “If people only knew how much of their suffering is engineered. They don’t need a savior. They need a reckoning.”  

Todd’s manifesto detailed how the majority of the population could be physically transformed—made “good” instead of “evil”—if they had the means to purify their lives:  
- **Clean nutrition**, free of corporate toxins.  
- **Simple biopsychological training**, using sensory triggers to cultivate discipline and motivation for exercise.  
- A cultural shift in how society viewed beauty: *not as shallow, but as sacred.*  

“Eighty percent,” he wrote. “Eighty percent of Americans would be radiant if they knew what to eat, if they had access to real food, and if they could master their impulses. But the system keeps them fat, weak, and ugly. Ugliness is the weapon of the elites, and they propagate it like sin.”  

Todd wasn’t naïve. He knew these ideas would never gain traction in the mainstream. That’s why he was building something else: a network. Online forums, anonymous chatrooms, and secretive meetups. People disillusioned with society's current trajectory flocked to him, intrigued by his blend of pseudoscience, self-help, and conspiracy.  

They began calling themselves *Beauticians*, and their goal was revolution—starting small, with their own lives. Todd coached them on how to grow their own food, filter their water, and detoxify their bodies. He taught them discipline through a system he claimed was based on ancient neural triggers: smells, sounds, and sights that activated primal motivation for movement.  

But Todd wanted more than a movement. He wanted to infiltrate, to take over from the inside. He dreamed of a day when the ugly and the poisonous would be cast out—exiled to live among their own filth—while the virtuous and beautiful rebuilt the world in their image.  

He closed his journal with a heavy sigh, knowing his ideas were walking a tightrope between brilliance and madness. His followers were growing, but so was the scrutiny. Reports of Todd’s teachings had already reached the wrong ears. A quiet investigation was underway. Todd suspected as much, though he didn’t fear it.  

He smirked and whispered to himself: “Let them come. I’ve planted the seeds. Beauty will triumph, no matter the cost.”  

Far away, in a stark government building, an agent stared at a photo of Todd pinned to a corkboard. Below it were snippets of his writings and a label: **POI: Cult Leader. Targeting for Deprogramming.**  

Todd, blissfully unaware, was preparing for what he saw as the next great evolution of humanity. Whether the world would see it as salvation or damnation remained to be seen.

**The Law of Beauty**  

Todd hunched over his desk, pen scratching across paper. The room was quiet except for the soft hum of an air purifier in the corner—a device Todd had salvaged and repaired himself. He breathed deeply, savoring the clean air. Purity in all things, he believed, was the foundation of human beauty: the body, the mind, the soul.  

His philosophy wasn’t about exclusion or condemnation. It was about awakening humanity to its potential. Todd had written pages of his manifesto, a doctrine he called **The Law of Beauty.** He saw it as both a science and a moral imperative—a way to guide humanity toward a higher state of existence.  

“Beauty is the ultimate virtue,” Todd whispered, writing the words with deliberate care. “It is not mere aesthetics, but the culmination of health, discipline, and purpose. To propagate ugliness is to sin. To cultivate beauty is to fulfill the human spirit.”  

Todd had identified the problem early on: people didn’t know they were being sabotaged. Poisoned wombs. Processed food laced with toxins. Sedentary lifestyles. Society had normalized ugliness by making it systemic.  

“This isn’t a war of the beautiful against the ugly,” he muttered. “It’s a war against ignorance and decay. The ugly must be taught to see the light.”  

Todd’s manifesto outlined a path for self-transformation:  
1. **Nourishment:** Understanding how nutrition shapes the body and mind. “Eighty percent of Americans could be far more attractive,” Todd wrote, “if they simply knew what to eat and how to obtain clean, untampered food.”  
2. **Discipline:** Developing the will to exercise not out of obligation but out of joy. Todd proposed techniques based on biopsychological impulses: sensory triggers to rewire the mind for self-motivation.  
3. **Propagation:** The ultimate goal was not selfish vanity but the improvement of the species. To produce children who would embody the ideals of health, beauty, and vitality.  

“Beauty isn’t a gift,” Todd continued, “it’s a responsibility. Every person has the capacity to improve. To work. To propagate their best self.”  

His followers called themselves *Beauticians*. At first, they were just online voices—anonymous avatars sharing stories of how Todd’s philosophy was transforming their lives. A woman who had once weighed 300 pounds now posted photos of herself hiking mountain trails. A man with a crooked spine from childhood malnutrition was learning corrective exercises.  

But Todd wanted more than testimonials. He wanted action. He began hosting small, secretive gatherings in community centers and private homes. He taught people how to grow their own food, how to detoxify their bodies from environmental poisons, and how to rebuild their minds through sensory retraining.  

Todd preached his philosophy with the zeal of a prophet:  
“Religion has always been necessary to guide the masses, but now it must be joined with eugenics—not the dark, coercive history of it, but a voluntary, joyful pursuit of the good. Not for domination, but for propagation. Attractive parents raise attractive children. Strong parents raise strong children. This is how we heal the world.”  

Still, Todd knew his work was dangerous. He touched on topics that governments and corporations would not want exposed. He wrote cryptically about **"black-budget eugenics programs"** and how society’s ugliness was engineered to keep the population docile.  

“We are not the first to think of this,” he told his followers. “But we are the first to think of it for the good of all. The CIA and their ilk have poisoned us for control. We will cleanse ourselves for freedom.”  

Todd’s ideas were spreading, and with them came resistance. His critics called him a fanatic, a pseudo-scientist. Some accused him of being a cult leader. But Todd dismissed them. “They fear us because we are creating something beautiful,” he said.  

One evening, a follower asked him, “What if someone is beyond saving? What if they’re too ugly—too far gone?”  

Todd looked at the young man sharply. “No one is beyond saving. Ugliness is not a sentence, it is a challenge. The only sin is refusing to work on oneself. Our duty is to guide, to teach, to inspire.”  

For Todd, the end goal was never exclusion or rejection. It was redemption—helping each person realize their potential to contribute to the future of humanity. In his vision, beauty was not just an ideal. It was a birthright. A flame waiting to be kindled.
