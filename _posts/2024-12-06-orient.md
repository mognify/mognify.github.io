My #1 ambitious project right now is to make a program with LLM, ML, voice transcription (for training to record the sound of whoever is instructing me on how to do my job, i.e. in training; for performing to analyze the sound of whoever is asking me a question), LLM (to analyze the transcriptions and understand what im saying), ML (to look back on the trained answer/behavior), voice synthesis (TTS that recreates my voice to answer the question or prompt the user), and Qt (to display highlights showing me where it predicts i'll click, and what it predict's i'll type)...

it will be fed
