prompt name: movie character clip montage generator
i want a set of python scripts to complete this objective using object-oriented programming principles:
A. transcribe audio from a video, recognizing individual voices and labeling them with vague differentiating names like Character A, or Character B, denoted as just 'a', 'b', and incrementing from there... it must keep their voice clips and associated timestamps in an SQL database associate with their vague denoted name

B. have a LLM or something more fitting to 

prompt name: orient gui
i want a set of python scripts to complete this objective with emphasis on making each function set modular, i.e. identify which function call chains are isolated from other function calls (never called by certain groups of functions) and sort these into their own 
A. soundboard, to playback recordings of my voice, i need it to play to mic input channel, so i installed bn-audio virtual cable... i hope there's an alternative that allows me to just send it through my actual microphone input channel, or create its own virtual cable that both my actual mic and this program can go to, which can also be selected in 3rd party program's mic input menu
B. i want it to record into an SQLite database the following:
Ba. whenever the mouse is clicked, record the location of the click, and take a screenshot, then create a modified copy of that screenshot which selects the neighboring similar pixel colors within a user-defined range (i.e. if the RGBA of the neighboring pixel to what was clicked is at least 60% similar to the clicked pixel's RGBA, include that one in the selection, and continue recursively until no more candidates are acceptable)... store the click location, the screenshot, the modified screenshot, the process list, and which process window had 'window focus' (im not sure what Windows OS calls it, but like when you click on a Chrome window that's over a notepad window, the notepad window goes behind the chrome window)
Bb. whenever it recognizes the user say "pay attention", the script set (or "program") starts recording the audio until it no longer recognizes voice activity for 30 seconds... after which point it will run a voice recognizer to transcribe what was said
